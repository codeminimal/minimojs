# minimojs
The idea of this framework is to be simple to use, with less code as possible, and easy to learn. We want to apply the idea of "Learn a concept, not an API". In fact there are some APIs that you might need to learn. But it is minimal.


Despite of it is being used in a personal project, the framework is still not ready in terms of documentation, website, etc...

To see the project that is using the framwork (also under construction) goto:
